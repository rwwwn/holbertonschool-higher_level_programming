# Python - Data Structures: Lists, Tuples

This directory contains Python scripts that demonstrate how to work with data structures — specifically **lists** and **tuples**. This is part of Holberton's higher-level programming curriculum.

## 📚 Learning Objectives

- What are lists and how to use them
- Differences and similarities between strings and lists
- Most common list methods and how to use them
- How to use lists as stacks and queues
- What are list comprehensions and how to use them
- What are tuples and how to use them
- When to use tuples versus lists
- What is a sequence
- What is tuple packing
- What is sequence unpacking
- What is the `del` statement and how to use it

## ✅ Requirements

- Python 3.8.x
- Use `vi`, `vim`, or `emacs`
- Scripts must start with `#!/usr/bin/python3`
- All code must pass `pycodestyle` (version 2.7.\*)
- All files must be executable
- A `README.md` file is required in the project directory
