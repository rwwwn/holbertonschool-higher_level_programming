# JavaScript DOM Manipulation

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on using JavaScript to dynamically interact with and manipulate the Document Object Model (DOM). All scripts are designed to run in a web browser (tested with Chrome 57+).

## 📚 Learning Objectives

By the end of this project, you should be able to:

- Select HTML elements using `id`, `class`, and tag selectors
- Modify the style and content of HTML elements using JavaScript
- Handle user and DOM events (clicks, page load, etc.)
- Dynamically add or remove HTML elements
- Use the Fetch API to make HTTP requests and handle responses
- Understand and work with Promises
- Perform DOM manipulation without triggering page reloads

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- JavaScript (ES6+)
- HTML5
- CSS3 (for testing)
- Fetch API
- DOM API

## 📁 File Descriptions

| File            | Description |
|-----------------|-------------|
| `0-script.js`   | Changes the header text color to red using `querySelector` |
| `1-script.js`   | Changes the header color when clicking on `#red_header` |
| `2-script.js`   | Adds the class `red` to the header on click |
| `3-script.js`   | Toggles the header class between `red` and `green` |
| `4-script.js`   | Adds a new `<li>Item</li>` to `.my_list` on click |
| `5-script.js`   | Updates the header text to “New Header!!!” |
| `6-script.js`   | Fetches a Star Wars character and displays their name |
| `7-script.js`   | Fetches and lists all Star Wars movie titles |
| `8-script.js`   | Fetches the French translation for “hello” and displays it in the DOM |

## ⚙️ Requirements

- Do not use `var`; use `let` or `const`
- No page reloads allowed for DOM updates
- All scripts should be semistandard-compliant
- Use only native JavaScript (no jQuery or frameworks)
- Scripts must work when loaded from `<head>` (especially Task 8)

## 🧪 Testing

Each script is linked to a corresponding HTML file (`0-main.html` through `8-main.html`) for testing. Open the HTML files in Google Chrome and observe the behavior defined by each task.
