# Python - Object Relational Mapping (ORM) with SQLAlchemy

This project focuses on how to interact with a MySQL database using Python and SQLAlchemy ORM. The tasks cover everything from defining database models to querying and manipulating data using object-oriented approaches.

## üìö Summary

We implemented the following key components:

- Defined the `State` and `City` classes using SQLAlchemy's declarative base.
- Created and populated MySQL databases using `.sql` scripts.
- Used SQLAlchemy sessions to:
  - Retrieve records.
  - Add new entries.
  - Update and delete records.
  - Perform filtering, sorting, and joins.
- Ensured code compliance with `pycodestyle`.
