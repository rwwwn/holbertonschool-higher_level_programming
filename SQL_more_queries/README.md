# üìö SQL - More Queries

This project is part of the Holberton School curriculum. It focuses on more advanced SQL concepts including table relationships, user permissions, and complex queries.

## üìå Objectives

- Manage MySQL users and assign privileges using GRANT and REVOKE
- Apply table constraints: PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE, NOT NULL
- Use SQL joins (INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN) to combine data across tables
- Write subqueries and filter results based on complex logic
- Retrieve and analyze data from related tables efficiently

## üß† Key Learnings

- Creating secure and flexible MySQL user permissions
- Designing relational databases using constraints and keys
- Writing powerful queries using joins and subqueries
- Handling NULL values and applying aggregation functions
- Organizing and presenting data using GROUP BY and ORDER BY
